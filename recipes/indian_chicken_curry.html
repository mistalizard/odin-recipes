    <h2>What is Indian Chicken Curry?</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken curry from the Indian subcontinent typically features chicken
      stewed in a tomato-based sauce seasoned with aromatic spices. This recipe,
      like many others, calls for curry powder (a spice blend made with
      coriander, turmeric, cumin, and chili powder).
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>½ cup cooking oil</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups chopped onion</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons minced fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ cup water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
      <li>Sprinkle chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken
        in the hot oil in batches until completely browned on all sides.
        Transfer browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil
        remaining in the skillet. Cook and stir until onion turns soft and
        translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir curry powder, cumin, turmeric,
        coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion mixture;
        allow to heat together for about 1 minute while stirring.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon salt
        to the mixture; stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate.
        Pour in 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat
        with the sauce. Sprinkle garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the
        chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink in
        the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F
        (74 degrees C). Drizzle with lemon juice to serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
